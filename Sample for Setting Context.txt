A. Sample for Setting Context
Context (what are we trying to do and why)

Users have requested a “snooze” functionality in their inboxes.
User research has indicated that this is similar to “snoozing an alarm clock” - i.e., “Do not tell me about this email until such and such time.”
The feature we plan to implement will be available at an “email level” as well as on multiple emails at once (similar to the existing delete functionality).
